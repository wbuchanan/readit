d 'READIT': Easily Append Multiple Files of Different Types
d
d readit is a package designed to make working with multiple 
d files easy and performant.  No longer do you need to iterate
d over all the files and create Stata version files on disk.
d Now, you can just readit directly into memory...even if the 
d files were created with different programs (e.g., Feather,
d SAS, SPSS, HTML, Stata, CSV, etc...).
